I've been doing Common Lisp related work intensively for 14 years, including more than a decade of Common Lisp Open Source. I am a top Common Lisp Open Source contributor. I am the sole author and maintainer of [30 ready-to-use Public Domain Common Lisp libraries in Quicklisp](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/libraries/). I made the [modern public domain CLOS MOP specification](https://clos-mop.hexstreamsoft.com/)<a class="body-link" href="" target="_blank"></a>, one of our most important resources, based on Robert Strandh's work, itself based on AMOP. I am the sole author and maintainer of multiple important Common Lisp community resources, such as the [Common Lispers list](https://common-lispers.hexstreamsoft.com/), the [epic FORMAT table](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/articles/common-lisp-format-reference/clhs-summary/#subsections-summary-table), and the still incomplete yet already useful "[Notes and tips: Standard Common Lisp symbols](https://notes-and-tips.hexstreamsoft.com/)" article.</p>

See all my contributions at [HexstreamSoft](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/), which is now the [#1 Common Lisp site according to Alexa](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hexstreamsoft.com) as of October 2020. As of 4 november 2020, [HexstreamSoft](https://www.hexstreamsoft.com/) has been trending upwards for 60+ consecutive days (with 2 trivial exceptions), [is now in the top 250k](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/hexstreamsoft.com), and the absolutely insane site engagement metrics [peaked](https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1310714016273182720) at 14 daily pageviews per visitor, 25:17 daily time on site and 24.8% bounce rate on 28 september 2020, indicating intense interest in my work.

I am spearheading the nascent movement to [make Common Lisp a top 5 programming language by 2040](https://twitter.com/HexstreamSoft/status/1213964177657794577). I believe this is eminently achievable given proper approaches.
